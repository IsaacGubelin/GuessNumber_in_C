This number-guessing game uses only one single main.c file to run. A Makefile is also included, running "make" will run the gcc commands to compile main.
Inside the .vscode folder are various json files to make it possible to use VS Code's running/debugging capability. 

To play the game in your terminal, change directories to the top level where main.c is located. Run "./guess " to start the executable.
Your goal is to type an integer number into the terminal and guess a number randomly chosen at the start. The program will say if your guess is high or low.
